# Gateway to Research: data processing and analysis

This folder includes two notebooks for the processing and analysis of the data we have used in [Arloesiadur](http://www.arloesiadur.org).

We obtained the data from the [Gateway to Research](http://gtr.rcuk.ac.uk/)

Apologies in advance - these notebooks are rough around the edges, and primarily provided to help visitors and analysts understand how the data in Arloesiadur were analysed. We intend to polish, refactor and improve in due course. Thanks for your patience!
