# Industry data: data processing and analysis

This folder includes two notebooks for the processing and analysis of the industry data we have used in [Arloesiadur](http://www.arloesiadur.org).

We have obtained the data from various official (ONS) sources (you can find more information in the scripts themselves)

Apologies in advance - these notebooks are rough around the edges, and primarily intended to help visitors and analysts understand how the data in Arloesiadur were processed and analysed. We intend to polish, refactor and improve them in due course. Thank you for your patience!
